This is a website that acts as a fanbase for the girl grooup IRRIS. On the website, users would be able to learn more information about the general group and have easy access to links of where they can stream their music and general facts about the members. If you click on the disography navigation button, you're brought to the bottom of the screen that showcases a table and key for the table of their discogrpahy.

Fans can log in to their accounts by clicking the log in button on the far right of the navigation. They can also sign up for an account by clicking the sign up button on the log in page.

Fans can also learn more about the members by clicking on the panel associated with each member. As of right now, only the panel for the first member, I.L is working.
If fans click on the panel associated with I.L, they're brought to her member's page. General facts and information about I.L is listed on the right side of the screen. On the left side underneath her profile picture, fans would be able to click to other panels to see her history as an artist, a gallery page, and more of her solo projects. The history tab is a dropdown menu that allows you choose which era of history the fan would like to learn more about the artist.

Additionally, there's a fun interaction where you hover over the images that shares the representative symbols of each member. Text appears that tells the user what specific color, tarot card, and prism stone I.L possess as a part of the group.
